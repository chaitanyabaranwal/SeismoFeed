# SeismoFeed

SeismoFeed is an app which provides a database for all the earthquakes ever happened so you can make informed choices on the places you want to go to. It can be used for information purposes as well. It uses the USGS API to provide a list of earthquakes and the results can be altered by changing parameters such as minimum magnitude, sort by, and others.
